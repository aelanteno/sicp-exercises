These exercises are from *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, with Julie Sussman. The book can be found online [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and for sale in hard copy [here](https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871/).

In working the exercises, I used DrRacket with the language set to #sicp.
