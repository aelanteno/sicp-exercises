> [Exercise 1.13](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_thm_1.13). Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to &#632;<sup>n</sup>/&#8730;5, where &#632; = (1 + &#8730;5)/2. Hint: Let &#968; = (1 - &#8730;5)/2. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see section [1.2.2](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_sec_1.2.2)) to prove that Fib(n) = (&#632;<sup>n</sup> - &#968;<sup>n</sup>)/&#8730;5.
